Starting in the late summer of 2020, Jay, Eric, and some friends in UPE met
regularly to play poker over Zoom. The games continued into the Fall semester,
and quickly it wasn't just a few members of UPE who would be in attendance, but
also mutual friends, and soon friends of those friends as well, even from other
schools. As time went by, the stakes rose, pushing some members away while
making others more captivated than ever. Although some members grew into
(temporary) poker retirees, the group is now its own community for more than
just poker. We'll talk about how group grew into what it was today, some of the
highlights and low-lights, what we see as the future of the group, and maybe
even give our favorite poker tips.
