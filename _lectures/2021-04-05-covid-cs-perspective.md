I am not an epidemiologist, but my initial research specialty, computer viruses,
lead me to follow the COVID outbreak closely.  A year ago I was in the
super-paranoid camp, electing to cancel in-person class activities the day
before the University pulled the plug.  During the winter I wore two masks when
shopping.  Now I'm in the sunshine-and-roses camp: we are ALMOST through this
and I expect fall to be mostly normal!

So why do I believe this?  We'll start with a discussion not of human pathogens
but the digital kind: how they work, how they spread, and "how to 0wn the
Internet in your spare time".  Then carry through to what the situation was in
March, a reminder of what we knew, and how we needed to respond to exponential
processes.

And finally, we will discuss the situation today.  How and why the vaccines are
so miraculously good, why I am not unduly worried about variants, how the supply
is ramping up, and why I felt comfortable spending part of my spring break
visiting my parents who I haven't seen in over a year.
