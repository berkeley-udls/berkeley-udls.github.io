I'm Michael, a lecturer in EECS. My focus is technically on computer science
education, and software engineering. I am interested in building tools to help
people learn CS, but I have also gone deep down the rabbit holes of my hobbies.
I'm particularly fond of excellent coffee and cocktails, both of which make
little a little more enjoyable.
