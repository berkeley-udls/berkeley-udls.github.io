My name is Shaun and I am a third-year computer science student who is very
passionate about free travel and optimizing credit card rewards. I am constantly
doing research about the best signup bonuses and the most optimal way to redeem
rewards for thousands of dollars in value. I am very excited to speak about how
to get started in the game of points and miles.
