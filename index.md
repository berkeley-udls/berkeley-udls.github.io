The Undistinguished Lecture Series is a TED-style venture where anyone
can give a lecture on any topic they wish. This includes faculty, staff,
graduate students, and undergraduate students alike. Inspired by
[UDLS at UBC](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~udls/).

All lectures this semester are on alternate Mondays, 7pm to 8pm Pacific Daylight
Time in the HP Auditorium (306 Soda). The alternating Mondays start on 10/4,
which is when the first lecture will be.
