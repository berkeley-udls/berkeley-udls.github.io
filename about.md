The Undistinguished Lecture Series is a TED-style venture where anyone can give a
lecture on any topic they wish. This includes faculty, staff, graduate students, and
undergraduate students alike.

This program was brought to UC Berkeley by a handful of TAs in the EECS department,
but our hope is that it'll grow into a program that students and faculty from all
departments can attend and speak at.

Inspiration for this series is drawn heavily from the
[UDLS series at the University of British Columbia](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~udls/),
whose CS department has hosted this series for over a decade and seen over 400 lectures.
